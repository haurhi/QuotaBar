Quota Radar's core goal is to reduce quota anxiety: users should not need to repeatedly log into provider dashboards to know which keys still work, when quota resets, which credentials expired, and which checks consume real quota.

## Product Principles

- Prefer official usage or billing APIs. Use dashboard-session cookies only when no official API exists.
- Clearly separate API keys, admin credentials, and dashboard cookies so users do not paste a model API key where a cookie is required.
- Automatic refresh must avoid real quota consumption by default. Providers such as Brave, where a check performs a real search request, should be manual-only unless the user explicitly opts in.
- Secrets stay local. Source code, tests, README files, and GitHub Releases must never contain real API keys or cookies.
- Every provider needs clear diagnostics: usable, quota unknown, credential expired, connection failed, unsupported API, or quota-consuming check.

## Completed In v0.2.0

- Changed the menu bar popover into a quota-first provider overview grouped by `AI Search` and `LLM`.
- Enlarged the menu bar popover to reduce scrolling and fixed top/bottom clipping.
- Replaced fragile SwiftUI header actions in the popover with stable AppKit click targets so the first click works.
- Unified the main window and credential configuration order as `AI Search` before `LLM`.
- Made credential configuration distinguish API Key, Admin Credential, and Dashboard Cookie so Volcengine, XFYun Spark, and OpenCode Go are not mislabeled as plain API keys.
- Added launch at login, automatic refresh intervals, and the ability to disable automatic refresh; automatic refresh skips providers such as Brave that consume a real search request.
- Added menu bar transparency settings and propagated the configured transparency into inner popover cards.
- Added automatic reauthentication save for dashboard-cookie providers, with provider quota validation before persisting.
- Fixed refreshed dashboard cookies being overwritten by stale `~/.claude/settings.json` values. Claude settings are now imported only during first-run initialization, not during refresh.
- Kept the local secret file as the default credential store to avoid repeated login-keychain password prompts.
- Updated README, Quickstart, Release workflow notes, and unsigned DMG / Gatekeeper documentation.
- Updated README main-window and menu-bar screenshots from the running v0.2.0 app.
- DeepSeek, Bocha, and WeChat Search now display CNY balance values instead of credits or percentages.

## P0: Current Version Hardening

- [x] Update outdated QUICKSTART settings-page wording to "Settings".
- [x] Check Chinese and English docs for unsigned DMG, disabling automatic refresh, Brave auto-refresh skip behavior, and cookie-provider setup.
- [x] Improve Release workflow notes so unsigned DMG users see the Gatekeeper workaround clearly.
- [x] Keep the current unsigned DMG release path. Developer ID signing and notarization remain optional future work.
- [x] Keep avoiding Keychain as the default secret path to reduce repeated login-keychain prompts.
- [x] Run screenshot QA for v0.2.0 menu bar transparency and refresh README screenshots.
- [ ] Fill in the provider capability matrix as the entry point for future provider additions.

## Fixed In v0.2.0

- [x] LLM coding plans in the menu bar must not always show the `5 hours` cycle. Compare all available cycles such as 5 hours, week, and month, then display the cycle with the lowest remaining percentage so a zero weekly quota is not hidden by a full 5-hour quota.
- [x] Fix Querit reauthentication when choosing Google login does not open the verification window.
- [x] Add a setting for automatic refresh of providers whose checks consume search quota, with longer interval choices than normal free checks to avoid wasting quota.
- [x] Re-investigate why menu bar transparency settings have no visible effect, including the outer popover, inner cards, and macOS material layers.
- [x] Add more language options, at least Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and fully localize descriptions, buttons, diagnostics, dates, period units, and provider configuration copy.
- [x] Simplify the `Credentials` page title hierarchy so the large title and subtitle do not both repeat "Credentials".

The broader UI redesign toward iStat Menus / Stats / Activity Monitor remains in P4, instead of being mixed into the v0.2.0 fix queue.

## P1: Credential Configuration UX

- [ ] Turn `Credentials` into a provider-aware wizard instead of one generic form.
- [x] Simplify the credential page title hierarchy so the page title and local heading do not repeat the same wording.
- [x] Show the basic expected credential type for each provider:
  - API Key: Tavily, SerpAPI, Serper, Bocha, DeepSeek, and similar providers.
  - Admin Credential: Exa Team Management service key plus target API key id.
  - Dashboard Cookie: Querit, XFYun Spark, Volcengine, and OpenCode Go.
- [ ] Add "paste cURL and parse automatically" for dashboard-cookie providers:
  - Extract the Cookie header from copied `curl`.
  - Extract `csrfToken`, `ProjectName`, and related fields from Volcengine cURL.
  - Extract `workspaceID`, `serverID`, and `serverInstance` from OpenCode Go cURL.
  - For Querit, save only dashboard-session cookies and reject plain `QUERIT_API_KEY`.
- [x] Make reauthentication auto-save:
  - Open the provider dashboard login page.
  - After the user logs in, read cookies from allowed domains.
  - Verify required cookies exist.
  - Save the credential to the local secret store after a successful test.
- [x] Fix Querit Google login in reauthentication; add OAuth popup/new-window handling or external-browser fallback if needed.
- [ ] Add credential state labels:
  - `Not Configured`
  - `Configured, Untested`
  - `Usable`
  - `Credential Expired`
  - `Quota API Unavailable`
  - `Check Consumes Quota`
- [ ] Add export/backup for credential metadata, but do not export secrets by default.

## P2: Connectivity Tests And Diagnostics

- [ ] Add an independent `Test Connection` button for each provider.
- [ ] Separate three test types:
  - No-cost ping: validates key/cookie format or account endpoint without consuming quota.
  - Quota check: reads real quota.
  - Costly check: consumes real quota and requires manual confirmation.
- [ ] Show richer diagnostics:
  - Last request time.
  - HTTP status.
  - Short provider error summary.
  - Whether a proxy was used.
  - Whether automatic refresh skipped this provider.
  - Next reset time or "provider does not expose reset time".
- [ ] Add proxy settings:
  - Use system proxy.
  - Manual HTTP proxy, such as `http://127.0.0.1:7890`.
  - Manual SOCKS proxy, such as `socks5://127.0.0.1:7890`.
  - No proxy.
- [x] Add automatic refresh settings for quota-consuming providers:
  - Disabled by default.
  - Clearly warn that real request quota will be consumed.
  - Use longer intervals than normal refresh, such as 6 hours, 12 hours, and daily.
  - Providers such as Brave join automatic refresh only after the user enables this.
- [ ] Add threshold notifications:
  - Quota below 20%.
  - Quota exhausted.
  - Cookie expired.
  - Provider connection failed repeatedly.

## P3: Provider Expansion

Acceptance criteria for a new provider:

- [ ] Find an official usage API, billing API, dashboard API, or confirm that only manual/dashboard-cookie monitoring is possible.
- [ ] Confirm quota units, reset cycle, and whether checking quota consumes real quota.
- [ ] Add parser fixtures; do not rely only on manual testing.
- [ ] Add provider icon, category, default credential name, and localized copy.
- [ ] Add `.env` and `~/.claude/settings.json` import rules.
- [ ] Add behavior tests and secret-safety checks.

### AI Search Candidates

- [ ] Perplexity / Sonar: verify whether official usage or billing APIs are available.
- [ ] You.com: verify API key usage or dashboard usage endpoint.
- [ ] Jina AI Search / Reader: confirm free quota, request quota, and reset behavior.
- [ ] Firecrawl: confirm credits API and team/project usage scope.
- [ ] Linkup: confirm API usage endpoint.
- [ ] Kagi Search API: confirm plan quota and usage API.
- [ ] Google Programmable Search: use Google Cloud quota/billing data; account for OAuth or service-account complexity.
- [ ] Azure Bing Search: use Azure quota/usage data; account for subscription and resource scope.

### LLM / Coding Plan Candidates

- [ ] OpenAI: verify billing/usage API availability, organization/project scope, and API-key granularity.
- [ ] OpenRouter: check credits and usage API.
- [ ] Gemini / Google AI Studio: check quota, billing, and project scope.
- [ ] Qwen / DashScope: check Alibaba Cloud usage and resource packages.
- [ ] Moonshot / Kimi: check balance and resource packages.
- [ ] Zhipu / GLM: check account balance and call quota.
- [ ] MiniMax: check balance and token usage.
- [ ] Baidu Qianfan: check account resource packages.
- [ ] Tencent Hunyuan: check account resource packages.
- [ ] SiliconFlow: check balance and API-key usage.
- [ ] Anthropic: currently hidden from the main UI; re-evaluate only if the user wants it and usage can be queried reliably.

## P4: Frontend Aesthetics And Interaction

- [ ] Establish Quota Radar's macOS monitoring-app design baseline:
  - iStat Menus: learn from dense but clear menu bar modules, refresh cadence controls, and settings grouping.
  - Stats: learn from lightweight native modules, compact metric blocks, and broad localization coverage.
  - Little Snitch Control Center: learn from menu bar diagnostics, recent activity summaries, and quick actions.
  - Activity Monitor: learn from main-window tables, grouping, filtering, summary areas, and diagnostic information hierarchy.
- [ ] Position QuotaRadar as `iStat Menus for API quota`, not a SaaS dashboard:
  - Numbers first: remaining, total, percentage, reset time, and update time beat decoration.
  - Moderate density: the menu bar shows only provider-level essentials; the main window carries detail.
  - Native material: use macOS sidebar, toolbar, popover, separators, and material instead of marketing-style cards and large gradients.
  - Nearby actions: refresh, reauthenticate, test connection, and open dashboard should sit close to the relevant provider.
- [ ] Keep the main window moving toward a modern macOS style:
  - Clearer sidebar hierarchy.
  - Less repeated information.
  - Provider banners collapse on click without relying on triangle icons.
  - Collapse animations compress in place instead of flying in from above.
  - Make the quota overview closer to Activity Monitor: table/grouping plus a side or bottom summary, not repeated card stacks.
- [x] Implement the menu bar popover's baseline monitoring interactions:
  - AI Search and LLM groups are shown separately.
  - Providers can collapse.
  - Credentials are sorted by remaining quota inside each provider.
  - Keys are shown as first four and last four characters, not environment variable names.
  - The popover auto-closes when the pointer leaves, without activating the main window.
  - LLM coding plans show the cycle with the lowest remaining percentage instead of always showing the 5-hour cycle.
  - Menu bar transparency is wired through and README screenshots have been refreshed from the running app.
- [ ] Deepen the next menu bar visual pass:
  - Make the layout closer to iStat Menus / Stats: compact metrics, fine separators, clear hierarchy, and no long scrolling dashboard.
  - Redesign the overall style toward Stats / iStat Menus monitoring panels: tighter modules, fewer large cards, clearer metric hierarchy, and a cleaner action area.
  - Keep improving transparency across different desktop backgrounds while preserving text readability.
- [ ] Continue using the battery/quota metaphor:
  - The app icon should be simpler and readable at distance.
  - The menu bar icon should work on light, dark, and transparent menu bars.
  - The menu bar popover's top-right action icon should be modern and semantically clear, not another generic grey circular button.
  - Use official provider icons when available; use consistent fallbacks otherwise.
- [ ] Add a visual QA checklist:
  - 13-inch display, wide display, external display.
  - Light and dark mode.
  - Chinese and English.
  - Long provider names, long error messages, many keys.
  - No text overlap or clipping.

## P5: Multi-Platform And Multi-Language

- [ ] Keep macOS as the short-term priority and preserve the native SwiftUI menu bar experience.
- [ ] If Windows/Linux support becomes necessary, evaluate Tauri or Electron before trying to port SwiftUI behavior directly.
- [ ] Centralize localization keys and avoid hardcoded business copy inside views or parsers.
- [x] Add language options:
  - Traditional Chinese
  - Japanese
  - Korean
- [x] Finish localization for dates and period units:
  - 5 hours
  - week
  - month
  - next reset
  - unavailable
  - quota unknown
- [x] Sweep all help text, settings text, buttons, diagnostics, errors, and release-facing docs so new languages are complete.
- [ ] Define provider-name rules:
  - Brand names usually remain untranslated, such as Deepseek, Serper, Exa, and Querit.
  - Generic states and quota units must be localized.

## P6: History, Trends, And Alerts

- [ ] Store the last N quota snapshots for trend display.
- [ ] Add consumption-speed hints, such as unusually fast weekly usage.
- [ ] Add local notifications:
  - Nearly exhausted.
  - Exhausted.
  - Cookie expired.
  - Balance restored or monthly reset detected.
- [ ] Add provider-level refresh history so users can tell whether refresh actually changed anything.

## Next Starting Plan

Continue with P1 + P2. Reauthentication auto-save is already in place; the remaining high-impact work is making configuration harder to get wrong and diagnostics easier to understand.

1. [ ] Build a provider capability matrix.
   - Suggested files: `docs/provider-capabilities.md` / `docs/provider-capabilities.en.md`.
   - Fields: provider, category, credential type, usage source, reset cycle, does check consume quota, diagnostic endpoint, notes.
2. [ ] Refactor the credential page into provider-aware forms.
   - Main files: `QuotaRadar/Models/APIKey.swift`, `QuotaRadar/Views/SettingsView.swift`, `QuotaRadar/Services/EnvImporter.swift`.
   - Goal: after selecting a provider, users only see fields that provider needs.
3. [ ] Add a cURL paste parser.
   - Main file: create `QuotaRadar/Services/CurlCredentialParser.swift`.
   - Goal: Querit, XFYun Spark, Volcengine, and OpenCode Go can extract cookies/headers from copied browser cURL.
4. [ ] Add per-provider connectivity tests.
   - Main files: `QuotaRadar/Services/QuotaService.swift`, `QuotaRadar/Models/QuotaMonitor.swift`, `QuotaRadar/Views/SettingsView.swift`.
   - Goal: each provider can test credential usability and disclose whether the test consumes quota.
5. [ ] Add proxy settings.
   - Main files: `QuotaRadar/Models/AppAppearance.swift`, `QuotaRadar/Services/QuotaService.swift`, `QuotaRadar/Views/SettingsView.swift`.
   - Goal: support system proxy, manual HTTP/SOCKS proxy, and no proxy.
6. [ ] Run a main-window and menu-popover visual QA pass.
   - Check screenshots across sizes, languages, and light/dark mode.
   - Prioritize overlap, clipping, repeated information, and collapse animation issues.

## Not Prioritized Yet

- [ ] Paid Apple Developer ID signing and notarization.
- [ ] Windows/Linux clients.
- [ ] Remote credential sync.
- [ ] Multi-user team dashboards.
